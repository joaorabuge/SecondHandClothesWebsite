# Second-Hand Clothing Store Website

## Final Project Proposal - DIAM

### Project Overview

Our project proposal involves the development of a second-hand clothing store website similar to "Vinted." The primary objective is to allow users to list their clothing items for sale, including photos and a brief description of each item's condition. Other users can browse these listings and purchase one or more clothing items directly from the site.

### User Registration and Login

To list an item for sale or purchase clothing, users must register for an account and log in. During registration, users will need to provide a name, email, and password. (In the later stages of the project, additional registration data may be required.)

### Key Features

1. **User Registration and Login**:
    - The homepage will offer options to either register a new account or log in if the user already has an account.
    - Only registered users will have access to the full functionality of the clothing sales application.

2. **Create a Listing**:
    - After logging in, users can post listings for their used clothes they wish to sell. If a user has not posted any listings, there will be no items displayed.

3. **View Listings**:
    - The homepage will showcase the most recent clothing items available for sale. A search menu will also be available for users to filter listings by specific parameters (e.g., clothing size, men's/women's clothing).

4. **Sort by Price**:
    - Users will have the option to sort clothing items by price, either in ascending or descending order.

5. **View Profiles**:
    - This feature allows users to view their profiles as well as the profiles of other users.

6. **Purchase Clothing Items**:
    - Users can purchase clothing items by entering their credit card information.

7. **Remove a Listing**:
    - If a user decides not to sell a particular item anymore, they can remove their listing from the site.

8. **View Shopping Cart**:
    - Users can view their shopping cart, which shows the items they intend to purchase and the total price to be paid.

### Conclusion

This project aims to provide a seamless platform for users to buy and sell second-hand clothing, promoting sustainability and affordability in fashion. By implementing these core functionalities, we will create an intuitive and user-friendly experience for all users.
